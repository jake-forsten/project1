Jake Forsten- Project 1
Project Details- The goal of this project for me was to create a business website for my career as a free-lance guitar player. I wanted to have images of myself playing and a bit of info about myself and my musical approach, as well as a look at some recent projects I've worked on. Lastly, I wanted to provide links to the equipment I use for other guitarists or fans of my playing to be able to know what I'm using and be able to check it out for themselves.
Functionality- the only real functionality here is the image carousel and the navbar and card links, which are pretty simple. I created them all using bootstrap.
Technologies used- HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
Ideas for future improvement- I think I could have been a bit more thorough about my formatting- I liked the idea of using the cards component in Bootstrap for most of my content, but I perhaps could have figured out a more unique or stylized way of accomplishing the same thing. I also perhaps could have gotten more in the weeds with CSS, because I really only used my style sheet very simply. I also could have found a way to offer more interactivity with the website, since the functionality is overall very basic. I think my forms section could have been more interesting.
